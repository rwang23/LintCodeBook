##Validate Binary Search Tree

22% Accepted

	Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

	Assume a BST is defined as follows:

	The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
	The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
	Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

	An example:

	  2
	 / \
	1   3
	   /
	  4
	   \
	    5
	The above binary tree is serialized as {2,1,3,#,#,4,#,#,5} (in level order).
