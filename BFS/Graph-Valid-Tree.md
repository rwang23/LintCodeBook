Total Accepted: 10169 Total Submissions: 31882 Difficulty: Medium
Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

For example:

Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]], return true.

Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]], return false.
